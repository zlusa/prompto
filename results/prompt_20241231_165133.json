    "analysis": "The prompt is very high-level and describes a desired outcome (building an app) rather than a visual scene. It lacks any visual elements, making it unsuitable for image generation. It needs to be reinterpreted to focus on a visual representation related to the concept of a water intake app.",

      "basic": "A minimalist app interface design for a water intake tracker, featuring a glass of water icon and a progress bar.",
      "detailed": "A photorealistic close-up of a smartphone screen displaying a water intake app interface. The app features a clean, modern design with a vibrant blue water droplet icon, a circular progress bar, and subtle glassmorphism effects. The background is a soft, blurred gradient. The lighting is bright and even, simulating a natural indoor setting.",

        "A stylized illustration of a water intake app interface, with a playful cartoon water glass character and a colorful progress wheel.",

    "tips": [
      "Focus on visual elements: Translate abstract concepts into concrete visual objects, scenes, or interfaces.",
      "Specify style and details: Include details about the desired style (e.g., photorealistic, minimalist, cartoon), lighting, and composition.",
      "Use keywords related to UI/UX: Incorporate terms like 'app interface,' 'progress bar,' 'icon,' 'wireframe,' 'mockup' to guide the AI towards generating relevant images."
