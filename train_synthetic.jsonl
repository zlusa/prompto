{"question": "A baker makes 5 batches of cookies, and each batch has 12 cookies. How many cookies did the baker make in total?", "answer": "To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of batches by the number of cookies per batch. So, we multiply 5 batches * 12 cookies/batch. This is the same as adding 12 five times: 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 60. Therefore, the baker made 60 cookies. <ANS_START>60<ANS_END>", "final_answer": "To find the total number of cookies, we need to multiply the number of batches by the number of cookies per batch.

{"question": "If 3 friends want to share 27 candies equally, how many candies will each friend get?", "answer": "To divide 27 candies equally among 3 friends, we need to perform the division 27 / 3. We can think of this as how many groups of 3 are in 27. 3 * 9 = 27, so 27 / 3 = 9.

{"question": "Sarah has 15 books. She buys 3 more books and then gives 6 books to her friend. How many books does Sarah have now?", "answer": "First, Sarah has 15 books and buys 3 more, so we add 15 + 3 = 18 books. Then, she gives away 6 books, so we subtract 18 - 6 = 12 books.
